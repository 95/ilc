This week, I learned about Matrix Operations in Linear Algebra, the basics of Python, and then implemented the OOP aspects of Python. I also implemented Matrix Operations in Python using Numpy as well. 
It was a good first few things to begin with, I realized that it’s a lot simpler than I thought it would be. 
A question that I will want to answer in the future is, how do function operations on matrices work? I also found out that the “pass” keyword exists. 
I never knew that before! 

I also was enthused to learn the distinction between a scalar and vector – something that I’ve had confusions about prior. 
Understanding the attributes that vectors have, which are magnitude and direction, has been key in clearing up some confusion for me. 
Also understanding that two vectors can be equal even if they are on different points in a graph has been super helpful.
