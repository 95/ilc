Image compression was pretty fun.
It also helped me learn more about principle component analysis.
PCA allows us to boil our set down to what matters the most, while also making sure that we keep the data we care about.
It's like a life hack for machine learning. It's pretty cool. 

In other words, it takes an n-dimensional dataset and finds the best axis (the one that preserves the most variance), 
and then plots the points of the dataset onto it. 

I had a lot of trouble with this lab, even though it was fun. 
There were some dependency problems with cv2, and my computer was being a bit iffy about the imports.
I reinstalled Python and it ended up working. Weird.
During the lab, I broke down the image into multiple pieces based on the 3 channels and then
reduced the number of components for each piece using PCA.

Then, I put it back together.

Not only did I learn about PCA during this lab, I also learned about how image compression works.

The additional two Python files are for the CTF. Xorly I was able to solve after a minor headache and lots of stackoverflow.
The ctfcbc I was never able to solve, though I gave it a valiant effort. I wouldn't like to talk about that. It was a nightmare.
