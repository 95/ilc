This week, I began looking at asynchronous functions in Python, which includes creating and managing multiple asynchronous tasks. 
I also continued my studies in Vectors, ending with covering the concept of Unit Vectors – which were pretty simple to understand.
Also began looking at Vector Spaces, which was a term I hadn’t heard of before. Naturally, they have a bunch of rules, many of them being “identities” or something of the sort. 
It didn’t interest me much. The attributes, such as dimension and basis are all straightforward, however.

This week’s learning made me realize that asynchronous tasks in Python are incredibly important. To have something run in the background of your application without it having to pause for a response can be useful in many contexts, especially web requests or queues. 
I read that it also helps for GUI programming, as when data is loading, the UI still needs to be able to respond to user input.
