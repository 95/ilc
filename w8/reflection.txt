I've heard the terms bias and variance a lot. 
These two terms seemed very important within machine learning, so I thought it'd be useful to learn about them.
I thought it'd be a lot more difficult than it was. 

They're just attributes to describe how data is organized.
For a given set of points:
Being closer to the truth means that there's low bias.
Being further from the truth means that there's high bias. 
Being more spread out means there's more variance, and being less spread out means there's less variance

The worst case scenario is that there is high bias and high variance, which means that the data
isn't grouped well (very scattered) and that it's not accurate whatsoever.

I also dabbled in some functional programming for a bit (because you told me to), but I quickly
realized why I wanted to do an ILC instead of haskell. I don't like functional programming at all.
However, I did appreciate how it worked in Python and saw the advantages of it. 
It allowed me to generalize a higher order function quickly.

Toward the end of the week, I wanted to do some LeetCode challenges in Python. I included one of my answers.

Then, I also wanted to do something asynchronously with Selenium. 
I made an update checker bot for Discord, which determines whether the new update has been released or not. 
This was less about making an actual tool and more about making code that is asynchronous and works.

I learned a lot about async just by programming this.
